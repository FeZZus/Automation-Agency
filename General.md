-	Free website, mailing list, posters/qr codes for their mailing list, 
-	I work with them to get: 
  -	Slow times of the week/day to give offers
  -	Festivals typical to their culture
  -	Birthdays, holidays, pormotional events
  -	**Maybe do an intiial setup with them, then just let them run it from there**

 
#### Workflow:
-	Customer scans QR code for free coffee/loyalty program
-	They open up a form and submit their details
-	We create a contact with them on our CRM
-	And then cofnirmation SMS is sent to the customer for their free coffee.

###### THEN: We offer direct text marketing
-	On slow days, you send out mass text SMS to the people for a limited buy one get one free special 
-	Then seats fill up
  -	WE BUILD UP A LARGE CONTACT LIST INCREDIBLY FAST WITH DIRECT CONTACTS TO YOUR MOST LOYAL CUSTOMERS. Gets bigger and bigger every day and increases revenue for the restauaraunts
  -	Look, the reason why these big chain restaurants are so powerful is advertising, everyone knows what a coke is, but why do they advertise it? Small business owners need the power of direct marketing to equalise the playing field
