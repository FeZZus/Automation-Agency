<br>

### What to offer them: 
-	https://www.skool.com/automation-agency-9540/classroom/1893d60f?md=d3e4929e35284e28b249542b8bdb0720 – end of this vid discusses it
-	Free website, mailing list,
	-	Posters/qr codes for their mailing list
-	Just anhythign to make them take out their phone and scan the web page. 
-	I work with them to get:
    -	Slow times of the week/day to give offers
      - (Can be set in advance)
    -	Festivals typical to their culture,	Birthdays, holidays, pormotional events
    -	GIVEAWAYS: Sign up for free dinner for 2
    -	**Maybe do an intiial setup with them, then just let them run it from there**

**Selling Point:** Restauraunts allow custoemrs to sit down eat their food and whatever, and then they leave. But the restauraunt then after that they dont know who the people are, if they're ever gonna come back, if they're enjoyign their meals or have any means of communicating with them (some stat about people that would come back). Currently majority of businmess communicate with their customers wihh social media, but that requries a lot of luck, is brodacasted to people who live hours away, it doesn't work and isnt foolproof. 
**Another selling point**: Texting lists, he has a lannding page somwhere after getting the licence that says why you need a text list (we can pitch this)
**Another selling point**: MUST DO IT FOR FREE FIRST, THERES NO POINT IN TURNING US DOWN - NO BRAINER
<br>

### Workflow:
-	Customer scans QR code for free coffee/loyalty program
-	They open up a form and submit their details: Email and SMS
-	We create a contact with them on our CRM
  - Internal notification can be sent to business owner as well
-	And then cofnirmation SMS is sent to the customer for their free coffee.
  
- THEN: We offer direct text marketing
  -	On slow days, you send out mass text SMS to the people for a limited buy one get one free special 
  -	Then seats fill up
  -	WE BUILD UP A LARGE CONTACT LIST INCREDIBLY FAST WITH DIRECT CONTACTS TO YOUR MOST LOYAL CUSTOMERS. Gets bigger and bigger every day and increases revenue for the restauaraunts
  -	Look, the reason why these big chain restaurants are so powerful is advertising, everyone knows what a coke is, but why do they advertise it? Small business owners need the power of direct marketing to equalise the playing field
