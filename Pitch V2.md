## Main Pitch
Hello my name is faraz, we’re a local software and automation company and we’re offering to help business like yours keep customers coming back, through boosting customer retention. If that sounds like a whokle lot of rubish, and if you don’t mind, I’d like to invest a few minnutes of your time into exploring the idea, and by the end of it, we might create something incredibly meaningful for your business, or I can leave and you will never see me again  Let me just preface this by saying that over the next few weeks we’re giving business a completely free trial of our services, and pretty much everything I say today, and if you don’t see any value in what we’re offering, we can come back at the end of those few weeks, take our stuff, and it will be like we were never here which is fair right?

We help setup mailing lists from posters like these that offer some form of customer incentive. People scan it and sign up. Loads of people come in a day, and lets say a dozen of them sign up to your mailing list. And the next day, and the next. And before you know it you have a means of communicating with 100’s of your customers. The types people that are receptive to a good deal, and would most likely come back to your restraint. Now as that mailing list is growing completely automatically in the background, and it’s a bit of a slow day like this. Now imagine that at the click of a button, you could communicate with 100’s of those past customers, who might be planning their day, or coming out to the highstreet for lunch and at the click of your button you can send them a 20% off discount that first of all reminds them that you exist, and second of all incentivises them to come to your business right. I’m sure you would agree that having access to a system like that just makes sense right? If I was a customer walking down the highstreet, or getting ready to go out for lunch  I woulnd’t go to pizza express or slug and lettuce if fratellis was doing a special limitd time 20% off discount. At the very simplest level, it makes sense to have a system like that

At this point, some people rightly think, but what if that customer, wasn’t going to the hgistreet, then that voucher, and our services are completely wasted. But I think the biggest benefit of having that a mailing list growing in the background means to directly communicate with your customers, and pushing yur brand reinforcement. It’s the same reason why coca cola spends billions a year adveritisng their product, when everyone already knows what a can of coke is. Its about engaging your customers attention, so that they don’t forget who you are. Customers will come in order, eat, enjoy your food. 

Now look, once again, if those kind of systems interest you at all, we can swing back in a few days and get you guys setup completely for free no contract no nothing just to trial our services for the next couple of weeks. 

<br>

**What other services:**

<br>

Once you have the mailing list setup, our software and automatoin is incredibly powerful, we can send out your standard offers, promotions, discounts, on top of that we can do giveways or raffles, once a month you give away a free dinner for 2. We can send out discounts for peoples birthdays a week in advance when they’re making celebration plans, they’re reminded you guys exist “oh yeah, place name, maybe I should take all my freidns and family to your restaruaunt for dinner.” And that’s getting people thoruhg your door, and making you money. It doesn’t even have to be a monetary inceitve, you can just wish them a happy birthday, or a merry christmas, or inform them of a new menu item. It literally is just all about that brand reinforcement, and engaging with your customers.  

The reason why its so invalauble to push for repeat customers as opposed to new customers, is that first of all, regardless of the type, they’re going to spend the same amount of money right. That’s intuitive, your items are the same price. But it takes a lot more effort and money to market to new people to accept the risk of going to a new restaurant, as opposed to someone who has already been to your restaurant, enjoys the food there, and just needs a small push to get them to come back. 


<br>

### How will this actually help me?/ “I DON’T THINK WE’RE INTERESTED”
That’s fair enough, now look, not all companies are looking to scale, or may be comfortable with what they are making which is of course up to them. I’m sure you would agree, that now so more than ever, places on the highstreet are facing heavy competitions, from typically larger corporate chain restauraunts  which have far stronger brand reinforcement and customer retension. Now scaling your business or not, your competing against these chain restaraunts which would typically have systems like the blue light card, taste card, mailing lists of their own, and massive amounts of advertising budgets and one of the only ways you can kind of compete is to start offering similar services of your own. It works both ways, why would you come to fratellis if lartista across the road had just sent you a 20% off voucher right? 
We allow you to do those things, that typically bigger chain restauraunts offer, and directly communicate with your customers, at a click of a button, but at an independent restauraunts like yours, on a more local scale and at a much more convenient price point. You don’t have to hire an entire marketing team, it really is the press of a button and a few drag and drop templates.

### IF THEY SAY YES: If they say no, just start with “before we leave…”
I should mention that we’re more than happy to set you up and run our services completely for free over the next 2-3 weeks for you guys, we’ll throw in a couple of free SMS campaings, and in that time, for a decently sized restaurant like your own, we’d expect a mailing list to grow to about 100-150 people once again at no expense to you other than providing a few viable customer incentives, no contracts no nothing. If it gets to the end of those couple weeks, and you still don’t believe that this is something that could genuinely help scale your business, we can scrap the whole thing, we’ll take our posters back, and it will be like nothing ever happened. I’d be happy to get back here even within the next few days with a couple of QR codes, posters, similar things, just to get you guys started.

## Comebacks during ptiching
- Google Reviews
- **Website:** Many businesses don’t have websites or very basic ones that aren’t capturing leads for them.

<br>

- **Why CRM:** Many businesses currently use pen and paper or excel to track their leads and customer information, these are outdated, cant be scaled, all your information about your customer in one place

<br>

- **Why SMS:** Texting lists, he has a lannding page somwhere after getting the licence that says why you need a text list (we can pitch this). Now, reasearch says that 95% of SMS messages are opened within the first 3 minutes of receiving them.  SMS is easy for them to manage, saving you an incredible amount of time, no need to bother with fancy formatting.

<br>

- **But social media is the same:** Very true, we agree social media is an incredible way of getting your name out there, but it relies on a lot of luck, the majority of your viewers will never have even been to YOUR LOCATION/COUNTRY and have no intention of visiting again.

<br>

- **We want to do our own marketing:**
  - Regading if they want to do their own marketing, our clients can go into the marketing tab on the software, and then they can invite their marketing person (if they have one) straight into that tab. If they have their own marketing people, they’re probably already using a tool like this, but  at no extra cost to them, we can provide them value through brining together all your social medias, post scheduling, and marketing strategy visbility to the boss and other members of the team all in one place.

<br>

- **How do we do automative marketing:**
    - We put out a few qr codes and posters that your users sign up on with incentives like a free appetiser or something.
    - They get taken to a form where they put in their phone number/email address, and they get sent a voucher/code for their appetiser
    - Behind the scenes our technology manages all the forms hosting, automation behind the voucher sending, and **most importantly adding customers to our CRM**
    - As each day goes buy, we build up an incredibly large contact list incredibly fast with direct contacts to your customers.
        - Gets bigger and bigger every day and increases revenue for the restauaraunts
        - From that directly give them more offers to incentivise them to keep coming back and build that **brand reinforcement**
        - From there the capabilities are limitless, whenever you want, you can directly engage with 1000's of your customers to ask them for reviews, give them birthday offers, send them promotions for big events, holidays, religious festivals.
