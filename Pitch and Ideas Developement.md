## Main Pitch
Restauraunts allow customers to come in, sit down, order and enjoy their meal, but then they leave. After that, the restauraunt doesn’t know who they are, if they’re ever coming back, or if they enjoyed their meal because theres no way of communicating with them after that point. And THAT lack of connection genuinely loses businesses similar to yours thousands of pounds a week through not retaining customers effectively, and I’ll tell you why. 

We specialise in ensuring that that revenue isnt lost, and  ensuring your customers keep coming back. Now, we can’t give you a few magic ingredients to make your pizzas taste better or your kitchen run smoother. 

But you might notice that one of the biggest advantages that larger chain restaurants like Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Zaza have is:
-	**One brand reinforcement,**
-	**and two, regular exposure.**

Think about it, if everyone knows what a can of coke is, why do they still advertise it on national television and every sports event? It’s about staying at the top of your customers mind

Now, look, we are an automation and web design agency, and we specialise in two main things:
1.	First, website building – every modern business needs one, and a good one, that engages your customers and doesn’t drop leads. 
2.	Customer Relationship Management, including introducing that curcial means of staying connected with your customers
3.	Secondly, automated marketing campaigns that ensure your customers keep coming back. Imagine it’s 11am on a Tuesday, and you know you’ve got 3 chefs and 2 more waiters on payroll for the lunch shift but theres no customers. At the click of a button, imagine you could directly communicate with hundreds of your customers, send out a 2 for 1 Tuesday Appetiser special, or a 25% off voucher only valid for the next 3 hours or so. That’s literally just bringin in more customers.

## Figures:

## Comebacks during ptiching
- Google Reviews
- **Website:** Many businesses don’t have websites or very basic ones that aren’t capturing leads for them.

<br>

- **Why CRM:** Many businesses currently use pen and paper or excel to track their leads and customer information, these are outdated, cant be scaled, all your information about your customer in one place

<br>

- **Why SMS:** Texting lists, he has a lannding page somwhere after getting the licence that says why you need a text list (we can pitch this). Now, reasearch says that 95% of SMS messages are opened within the first 3 minutes of receiving them.  SMS is easy for them to manage, saving you an incredible amount of time, no need to bother with fancy formatting.

<br>

- **But social media is the same:** Very true, we agree social media is an incredible way of getting your name out there, but it relies on a lot of luck, the majority of your viewers will never have even been to YOUR LOCATION/COUNTRY and have no intention of visiting again.

<br>

- **We want to do our own marketing:**
  - Regading if they want to do their own marketing, our clients can go into the marketing tab on the software, and then they can invite their marketing person (if they have one) straight into that tab. If they have their own marketing people, they’re probably already using a tool like this, but  at no extra cost to them, we can provide them value through brining together all your social medias, post scheduling, and marketing strategy visbility to the boss and other members of the team all in one place.

<br>

- **How do we do automative marketing:**
    - We put out a few qr codes and posters that your users sign up on with incentives like a free appetiser or something.
    - They get taken to a form where they put in their phone number/email address, and they get sent a voucher/code for their appetiser
    - Behind the scenes our technology manages all the forms hosting, automation behind the voucher sending, and **most importantly adding customers to our CRM**
    - As each day goes buy, we build up an incredibly large contact list incredibly fast with direct contacts to your customers.
        - Gets bigger and bigger every day and increases revenue for the restauaraunts
        - From that directly give them more offers to incentivise them to keep coming back and build that **brand reinforcement**
        - From there the capabilities are limitless, whenever you want, you can directly engage with 1000's of your customers to ask them for reviews, give them birthday offers, send them promotions for big events, holidays, religious festivals.
